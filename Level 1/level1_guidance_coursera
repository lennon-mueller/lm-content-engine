Part 1. Course Design Principles
Coursera follows three fundamental principles that work together to create modular, skill-aligned learning experiences:

Skill-First Learning: Each course is aligned to specific skills or skill areas
 ⇨ Content specifications will define the skill focus


Standalone & Stackable Courses: Every element works independently and in combination
 ⇨ No dependencies, unlimited reusability


WWHAA Design Footprint: Use this design pattern for every module
 ⇨ Consistent, effective learning through Why-What-How-Apply-Assess design pattern

These principles work together: You'll create skill-first courses that are standalone and stackable, using the WWHAA footprint for each module. 
Principle #1 - Skill-First Learning
Your primary objective is to enable and validate skill mastery. 
Verified Assessments
Verified Assessments are rigorous evaluations in the Skill Mastery framework that provide evidence of a learner's ability to perform skills in practice. These assessments fully and accurately measure Skill Expressions by covering their intended scope and evaluating performance at the appropriate Bloom's level (e.g., Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create).

Understanding that learners will be working toward passing a Verified Assessment helps you design course content and assessments that align with this standard of skill demonstration, ensuring learners develop the practical competencies needed for authentic workplace application.
Assessment Design Principles
Verified Assessments are grounded in authentic, workplace-relevant scenarios and project-based tasks that mirror actual professional challenges. Rather than decontextualized exams, these assessments present learners with complex, realistic situations that require them to demonstrate real-world skill application.
Skill Expression Coverage
Each Skill Expression must be assessed at least once within the Verified Assessment framework. Assessment questions are designed flexibly; e.g., a single scenario-based question can evaluate multiple Skill Expressions simultaneously, while individual Skill Expressions may be assessed through multiple questions when comprehensive validation is needed. This approach ensures thorough coverage while maintaining authentic, job-relevant assessment experiences.
Alignment to Learning Levels
All assessment items must align to appropriate Bloom's taxonomy levels that match the cognitive complexity of the target Skill Expressions. Assessments focus on higher-order thinking skills (Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create) that reflect real workplace demands rather than lower-level recall or comprehension.
Skill Areas
Each long course is centered on a Skill Area. A Skill Area is a learner-facing grouping of related skills that support a common phase of work or functional objective. The skills in a Skill Area are commonly taught, practiced, or applied together. Skill Areas support navigation, credential design, and curriculum bundling, without defining structural or prerequisite relationships.
Skills
Each module within a short or long course addresses one Skill. Skills are learned competencies — specific knowledge, techniques, or abilities that can be developed through practice, training, or experience.
Skill Expressions
Each skill is associated with one or more Skill Expression. A Skill Expression is a discrete, observable, and measurable capability that enables a person to perform a specific task or function. Skill Expressions are the building blocks of our Skill Mastery measurement system. 
Skill Expressions & Learning Objectives
When designing your course, Skill Expressions serve as the foundation for your learning objectives. In some cases, a Skill Expression may directly become a learning objective. However, complex Skill Expressions often need to be broken down into multiple, more specific learning objectives that scaffold learners toward mastery. 

For example, a Skill Expression such as “Apply visual design principles to enhance clarity, impact, and narrative in visualizations” might translate into separate learning objectives covering color theory, typography, layout principles, and storytelling techniques. Your role is to determine the appropriate level of granularity that supports effective learning while ensuring all aspects of the Skill Expression are addressed.
Structuring the Learning Experience
Here is how the Skill Mastery framework maps onto Coursera platform structures:

Long Course (multiple modules) ⇨ Skill Area
Short Course (typically one to three modules) ⇨ Skill
Module ⇨ Skill
Items ⇨ Skill Expression(s)

Short Courses are designed around a specific Skill and typically consist of one focused module. When there are multiple Skill Expressions or Skills that require more comprehensive treatment, short courses may include additional modules.

Long Courses are designed around a specific Skill Area and consist of multiple modules where each module addresses a skill. 
Skill Mastery System Definitions
The table below summarizes the terms used in the Skill Mastery measurement system. 

Taxonomy Level
Description
Content Format
Example
Verified Assessment
An assessment that fully and accurately measures Skill Expressions by covering its intended scope and evaluating performance at the appropriate Learning Level (Bloom’s). Completion provides verified evidence of the learner’s ability to perform the skill in practice.
Assessments are grounded in authentic scenarios/projects. 
See Verified Skills Assessment Design specs.
Graded Assignment(s) developed in their own module (1 assessment module: verified skill path)
Scenario: You are a junior data analyst at University Research Services. The Academic Affairs department has asked you to analyze student performance data from a recent study examining the relationship between study habits, learning environments, and academic outcomes. Your analysis will help inform decisions about course delivery methods and student support services.
Skill Area
A Skill Area is learner-facing grouping of related skills that support a common phase of work or functional objective. The skills in a Skill Area are commonly taught, practiced, or applied together.  Skill Areas support navigation, credential design, and curriculum bundling, without defining structural or prerequisite relationships.
(Long) Course
Data Analysis CB 1 has seven skill areas, e.g.,:
Data Acquisition & Preparation,
Data Transformation & Manipulation,
Data Visualization & Reporting, etc.
See full list in Finalized Module Mapping 
Skill
Skills are learned competencies - specific knowledge, techniques, or abilities that can be developed through practice, training, or experience.
Module

(May stand alone as a short course)
Data Visualization & Reporting skill area has skills: statistical validation, dashboard, data presentation, data storytelling, descriptive analytics (tags)
Skill Expression
A discrete, observable, and measurable capability that enables a person to perform a specific task or function. Skill Expression is the building block of our Skill Mastery measurement system.
Item(s)
Apply visual design principles to enhance clarity, impact, and narrative in visualizations.

Principle #2 - Standalone & Stackable Courses
All courses need to provide self-contained, standalone learning experiences that can function independently while also combining seamlessly into larger learning pathways. Each short course is a complete, valuable learning experience on its own.
Standalone Design Principles
Every element of your course—from individual items to complete modules—must be self-contained so that it makes sense on its own.

This also allows the content to be reordered, extracted, and used across multiple courses and programs. Because a single module may appear in more than one course or a single course may appear in more than one Specialization or Professional Certificate, authors should frame content so that it makes sense in different program contexts.

Do not reference other parts of the course, sequences of courses, or programs the course may be part of. Do include any necessary context within each item.

Here are some examples:



❌Don’t Say
✅ Do Say
Module Transitions
“Now that you’ve mastered the basics from Module 1, let’s apply those concepts to…”
“Data transformation is essential for analysis. Let’s explore how to use SQL functions to…”


“Building on our previous discussion about variables…”
“Variables store data values. Let’s see how to use them in functions…”
Course/Program References
“As part of this Data Science Specialization, you’ll use these skills in the capstone project…”
“These data preprocessing skills are essential for any machine learning project. Let’s practice with a real dataset…”


“This builds on the Python Basics course you completed earlier…”
“Using Python’s data structures, we can efficiently process large datasets…”
Stackability Across Programs
“This course is your first step in the Data Analyst Specialization.”
“These foundational data analysis skills are relevant across a variety of career paths.”
Sequential References
“In the previous lesson, we explored how to optimize this code…”
“Code optimization involves several key strategies…”


“In the next video, we’ll dive deeper into this topic…”
“As a next step, try the advanced features of this tool…”


“By now, you should have completed the three exercises from earlier…”
“Let’s practice with a hands-on exercise that demonstrates these concepts…”
Assessment References
“Remember this for the final quiz…”
“This concept is fundamental to understanding how databases work…”


“You’ll need this for your capstone project…”
“This skill has immediate application in real-world projects…”


“This extends what you learned in Assignment 1…”
“Let’s apply data validation techniques to ensure accuracy…”
Video/Reading Transitions
“As I mentioned in the previous video…”
“An important consideration when designing APIs is…”


“The reading you just completed explained…”
“RESTful APIs follow specific architectural principles. Let’s implement them…”


“Before watching the next video, make sure you understand…”
“Let’s ensure we have a solid grasp of these core concepts…”

Stackable Design Benefits
When courses are truly standalone, they become infinitely stackable:

Same course can appear in multiple learning paths
Modules can be reordered or extracted based on learner needs
Content remains relevant regardless of learning path
Updates to one course don't break dependencies
Principle #3 - The WWHAA Design Footprint
Every instructional module in a Coursera course should follow the WWHAA design footprint, a design framework that structures content delivery through five distinct phases: Why, What, How, Apply, and Assess.
Modules as the Building Blocks of Learning
For those who have worked with Coursera in the past, we've simplified our course architecture so that a module acts as the fundamental container of content within a course; there are no longer separate “lesson” containers within a module.
Old Structure:
Courses contained Modules
Modules contained Lessons
Lessons contained individual learning items
New Structure:
Courses contain Modules
Modules contain all learning items
No separate "lesson" container will be used
Modules are the “lessons” within a short course

Each module addresses one Skill, composed of one or more Skill Expressions. In long courses, multiple modules collectively cover all skills within a Skill Area. In short courses, typically one module addresses the targeted Skill Expression(s) directly. When the topic requires more comprehensive treatment, short courses may include additional modules while maintaining their targeted scope.
Working with Module Specifications & Course Structure
Your Role: Design effective learning experiences using the WWHAA footprint for each module.

You will receive information that includes:
Course format (long or short course)
Module titles
Occupation group (professional role for target audience)
Skill to address within each module
Skill expressions to cover in the learning items
Skill expression descriptions for more context
Job tasks (ideas for activities)

Job Tasks: Job tasks should be taken as illustrative examples. The learning designer and subject matter expert (SME) have latitude to identify and develop the most relevant activities to teach the skills. When developing scenarios, examples, or activities, design them for professionals in the specified Occupation Group — this is your target learner audience.

Tool Selection: Unless the skill expression or title explicitly mentions a specific tool, you have latitude to develop a manageable set of tools/projects. Consider all courses in the program together and select the most appropriate and relevant set of tools/languages, keeping in mind industry-standard tools and a manageable number of tools for the learner.

Long Courses (Skill Area-based): You'll implement multiple modules that work together to cover a comprehensive Skill Area. Each module addresses specific Skills within that broader area.

Short Courses (Skill-based): You'll typically implement one focused module, though some assignments may include additional modules when skill complexity requires it.

Item Sequencing: Mix Deliberately to Maintain Engagement
Item types should be mixed deliberately, avoiding more than two consecutive lectures or readings. Our internal research shows that sequences with varied item types consistently demonstrate higher learner progress and completion rates, while repetitive sequences result in lower engagement and increased drop-off.

Why sequencing matters: Our research reveals that learners drop off at significantly higher rates when encountering repetitive content patterns. Sequences featuring undifferentiated item types (e.g., five consecutive videos or clusters of three videos followed by two readings) create monotonous learning experiences that fail to sustain attention and momentum. Conversely, varied sequences keep learners engaged by alternating between different cognitive demands and modes of interaction, preventing the fatigue that comes from passive consumption of similar content types.

Key principle: No more than two identical item types should appear consecutively. Break up video sequences with readings, practice assessments, or hands-on learning activities to create a dynamic, engaging learning experience that supports sustained progress.
Introducing a Course
Purpose: Motivate learner with real-world value

Design Guidance:
Skip general welcomes (no syllabus reading or course introductory video)
Open with, for example:
Dialogue to assess prior knowledge, explore motivations, set learning goals
"Why" item that establishes real-world value for the topic
Lead with substance that shows immediate career applicability
Move directly toward skill acquisition

Recommended Item Types:
Dialogue - Use to assess prior knowledge or help learner establish personal relevance
Video - SME-led video connecting the skill to industry application
Reading - Scenario-based reading that frames the skill in context of learner goals
Ending a Course
Purpose: Validate achievement of course skill expressions

Design Guidance:
Include course graded assessment at the end of the last module
Exception: If the course involves a more involved hands-on course project with multiple items; then it may warrant its own module

Recommended Item Types: See “Assess” phase above for options
Required Assessments per Course
1+ formative activity (ungraded) per module
1+ knowledge check (ungraded) per module
1+ summative (graded) assessment per course

Remember, use practice activities and knowledge checks to checkpoint distinct skills in each module; and end the course with a graded assessment.
Learner Access to Tools
Learners often require access to software tools or platforms to learn the skills being taught. If a paid license is required, let learners know this in the course description (i.e., on the landing page) and within relevant course items (e.g., items that cover setup of the tool); then you can assume learners will obtain paid access to complete any necessary activities in the course. If open-access tools or free trials are available, let learners know about these options. 
Accessibility
Vendors are accountable to being up-to-date on the latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and ensuring they’re met when creating content.

Part 2. Creating Hands-on Learning Experiences
Leveraging AI for Hands-on Learning & Assessment 
Coursera's AI learning tools enable you to implement the design principles at scale by creating personalized, hands-on learning experiences that provide immediate feedback on authentic practice opportunities and hands-on graded assessments.
Coach Dialogue Items
Purpose: AI-powered Socratic conversations
When to use: Critical thinking, scenario analysis, concept exploration, reflection
Benefits: Personalized instruction, immediate feedback, scalable tutoring
WWHAA integration: Why (motivation), Apply (scenarios, reflection)

Dialogue items are course activities that enable authors to create AI-driven discussions, simulating interactions with a personal tutor. These items lead learners through structured, text-based conversations designed to achieve specific learning objectives.

In a live Dialogue experience, the AI guide (Coursera Coach) helps learners think critically and apply course concepts to real-world situations by asking adaptive, open-ended questions. Dialogues are tailored to each learner, providing personalized feedback that drives progress and deepens understanding.

For more details on using and setting up Coach Dialogues, see these Educator Resource Center articles:
Create and Publish Dialogue Items (ERC)
Effectively Using Dialogue Items (ERC)
AI Grading in Assignments and Peer Reviews
Purpose: Immediate, rigorous grading of open-ended submissions with personalized feedback
Where available: Assignment items, Peer Review assignments
Supported prompts and file types: Rich text and file uploads (video, audio, image, code)
WWHAA integration: Apply (hands-on practice), Assess (summative skill validation)
ASSIGNMENT Items with AI Grading
AI-graded questions use our AI grading system to evaluate text responses and file uploads (e.g., video, audio, code), providing a grade based on the rubrics you set up plus immediate, actionable feedback to help learners review concepts and assess their understanding.

Use cases:
Activities that involve artifact submissions or reflective responses
Quiz questions that require open-ended responses

Once you’ve developed the step-by-step instructions and submission prompts for an activity, create an Assignment item with your AI-graded questions and generate the rubrics for each submission prompt using the on-platform rubric generator tool. Review and revise the rubrics as needed before publishing. 

For more information, see this Educator Resource Center article:
Add AI-Graded Questions to Assignments (ERC)
PEER REVIEW Items with AI Grading
Note: As a first option, please use AI-graded assignments, reserving peer review assignments for justifiable use cases with well-designed rubrics. 

In peer review assignments, learners review and grade each other’s work. These are best used for assignments that do not have a single correct answer and require human evaluation, such as essays, design projects, case studies, etc. Peer review assignments facilitate this type of human evaluation at scale. 

The key to an effective peer review assignment is a well-structured rubric. Ask learners to rate individual components of the submission separately. Use simple, concrete language and quantified standards whenever possible.

Design the assignment with clear instructions and details on what learners need to submit. We recommend providing examples of the type of work you’re expecting to see and share the rubric with learners so they know how they will be evaluated (and how they will evaluate others). 

When AI grading is enabled for a peer review assignment, submissions are graded by our AI-grading system, providing a grade based on the rubrics you set up plus immediate, actionable feedback to help learners review concepts and assess their understanding. 

Learners also grade each others’ submissions. So peer review assignments work best when learners receive value in grading and critiquing each other’s work. If assessment of the learning objectives is the main priority (rather than facilitating peer-to-peer sharing of ideas), use a regular Assignment item with AI-grading instead of a Peer Review assignment.

For more information, see this Educator Resource Center article:
AI Grading in Peer Review Assignments

When designing your first peer review assignment, start with the design template below. Once you’ve mastered the basics; then consider using the import template for authoring the rubric.

Assessment Generator (for Multiple Choice Quiz Questions)
Purpose: On-platform AI-assisted multiple choice question creation in Assignment items
Features: Generate from learning objectives, videos, readings; Create question banks
WWHAA integration: Assess (knowledge checks, summative quizzes)

Assessment Generator is an AI tool that helps you create multiple choice quiz questions for Assignment items. It generates questions from learning objectives, module titles, videos, and readings. The tool integrates with question banks, allowing you to review, edit, and reuse questions across assignments.

As with all AI-generated content, Coursera considers these outputs a first draft that requires human validation and will benefit from editing or additions by SMEs/learning designers.

Developing Hands-on Learning Activities
The first principle of skill-first learning emphasizes the centrality of engaging learners in authentic, real-world scenarios that allow them to practice and eventually demonstrate mastery of the skills they are learning. Keep these tips in mind when developing hands-on learning activities and assessments. 
Characteristics of Effective Hands-on Learning
Active Engagement: Learners actively practice rather than passively consume content
Skill Development: Learners build competencies through direct experience and application
Artifact Creation: Learners produce tangible outputs demonstrating their learning
Problem-Solving Focus: Activities require critical thinking and analytical skills to complete tasks
Real-World Simulation: Exercises mirror authentic professional scenarios and challenges, leveraging the provided occupation group, career band, and/or job task inputs provided by Coursera
Safe Failure Environment: Learners can make mistakes and learn through trial and error without consequences
Learner Responsibility: Activities place ownership on learners to drive their own learning process
Creative Opportunities: Some exercises allow for open-ended, non-prescriptive outcomes and personal expression
Confidence Building: Structured exercises help learners develop competence before tackling more complex challenges
Higher-Order Thinking: Learning objectives target Bloom's Taxonomy levels of apply, analyze, evaluate, and create
Guiding Questions When Designing Hands-on Activities
Preparedness: Are learners adequately prepared, or is the difficulty jump too large?
Authentic Context: Does the exercise begin with a real-world problem that demonstrates clear value to learners?
Clear Instructions: Can learners easily get started? Are setup materials comprehensive for non-platform exercises?
Critical Thinking: Does the exercise promote independent problem-solving and decision-making rather than prescriptive step-following?
Scaffolding: Does the exercise break into manageable steps with examples, hints, and common pitfall guidance?
Difficulty Levels: Are there optional challenges or varying difficulty options for advanced learners?
Mitigate Sticking Points: What potential roadblocks exist, and how can they be prevented?
Feedback & Reflection: Do learners receive clear completion indicators, feedback, and opportunities for reflection?
Implementing Hands-on Activities
Practice Assignments: Step-by-step instructions for off-platform activities

EXAMPLE: Why Storytelling Matters on TikTok

The difference between content that goes viral and content that gets scrolled past? It's all in the story. That’s why mastering storytelling is essential for TikTok success.

People often make the mistake of thinking TikTok is just about dancing or trends, but at its core, TikTok is a storytelling platform. The most successful creators understand one critical fact: you have just 3 seconds to hook your viewer before they scroll away. Those first moments determine everything.

I learned this the hard way when I first started creating content. I spent hours filming high-quality videos with beautiful visuals, only to see them get barely any views. Why? Because I buried the hook too deep in the video. By the time I got to the interesting part, my audience was long gone.

TikTok's algorithm rewards watch time and engagement. When viewers watch your entire video and interact with it, the platform shows it to more people. This is why storytelling matters so much. It's the difference between 100 views and 100,000 views.

Consider a business account that sells handmade jewelry. Instead of just showing product photos, they might start their videos with: "The ring that made a customer cry with joy." That's a story hook that makes you want to know more.

Or consider a cooking account that begins with: "The 3-ingredient pasta that saved my dinner party when a guest announced they were gluten-free." Again, it's a story that pulls you in.

What successful creators understand is that TikTok isn't just a platform. It's a community built around shared stories. Whether your videos are 15 seconds or 10 minutes long, whether you're using video or the newer image carousel format, the principles of good storytelling remain the same: hook fast, create tension, and deliver satisfaction.

In today's crowded TikTok space, storytelling isn't just a bonus; it's absolutely essential. It's how you break through the noise, build a dedicated following, and transform casual viewers into loyal customers or engaged community members. By mastering these techniques, you'll be able to create content that not only stops the scroll but also forges genuine, lasting connections with your audience.

“Why” Vignette Videos – Level 1 Content Specifications
1. Purpose and Role in WWHAA
“Why” vignette videos support the Why phase of the WWHAA design footprint. They are short, motivating videos that answer one core question:
Why should the learner care about this topic or skill?
These vignettes:
Introduce a single skill, topic, or learning objective.
Create emotional and practical buy-in before learners encounter “What,” “How,” “Apply,” and “Assess” items.
Help learners see themselves and their goals in the story being told.
All “Why” vignettes must comply with the specifications below in addition to all other Level 1 requirements (Skill-First, Standalone & Stackable, WWHAA, accessibility, etc.).
2. Definition and Scope
A “Why” vignette is a short, instructor- or SME-led video with the following characteristics:
Duration: approximately 1–3 minutes.
Script length: approximately 200–450 words.
Character target: approximately 1,200–2,700 characters (including spaces), assuming ~6 characters per word.
Focus: motivation and relevance, not detailed instruction.
Connection: directly linked to the lesson’s or module’s learning objective(s).
“What” readings and “How” screencasts explain what something is and how to do it. “Why” vignettes explain why it’s worth learning and using.
“Why” vignettes are not:
Full instructional lectures.
Tutorials or walkthroughs.
Generic welcome videos unrelated to a specific skill or learning outcome.
3. Length and Duration Requirements
To maintain focus and impact:
Video duration:
Minimum: 1 minute
Maximum: 3 minutes
Script length:
Recommended: ~200–450 words total.
Character target: ~1,200–2,700 characters (including spaces) for the full vignette script.
This typically breaks down into:
Hook: 1–2 sentences.
Body: ~250–400 words.
Character target for body section: ~1,500–2,400 characters (including spaces).
Wrap-up: 1–2 short lines.
If a script exceeds 450 words:
Authors should tighten language and remove repetition.
The vignette should not be split into multiple parts; the purpose is a single, focused motivational moment.
4. Narrative Structure and Content Requirements
Every “Why” vignette must follow a clear, three-part narrative structure:
4.1 Hook (Opening, 1–2 Sentences)
Purpose:
Quickly grab attention and make the relevance obvious.
Requirements:
1–2 concise sentences.
Use language at or below 5th-grade reading level for the hook.
Clearly signal why this matters in the simplest possible terms.
Address the learner directly as “you” where natural.
Examples of hook intentions (not exact wording requirements):
“You use data every day—even if you don’t think of yourself as a ‘data person.’”
“If you can automate a task that takes you an hour every week, you get that hour back for the rest of your career.”
4.2 Body (Main Section, ~250–400 Words)
Purpose:
Build the case for why the skill or topic is important, valuable, and worth the learner’s time and effort.
Required content emphasis:
Job relevance:
How the skill or tool shows up in real job tasks.
How it helps learners do their work more effectively or advance in their careers.
Real-world preparation:
How the skill relates to realistic challenges or scenarios learners are likely to encounter.
Industry significance:
Why the skill/tool matters in the broader industry or field.
Value proposition:
What makes this skill worth learning now (e.g., opportunity, efficiency, impact).
Recommended strengthening elements (at least one should be present; several may be combined):
End results:
Describe the impact this skill or tool has on the job or in solving a concrete problem.
Authority via storytelling:
Brief, authentic anecdotes or experiences from the SME’s or industry’s real practice.
Empathy:
Acknowledge that learning can be challenging; share “I’ve been there too” moments.
Advice:
Offer reflective guidance such as “Here’s what I would have done differently earlier in my career.”
Direct address (“you”):
Help learners imagine themselves using the skill: “You’ll be able to…”.
Constraints:
The body should stay focused on “why,” not “how.”
Avoid detailed technical steps, interface descriptions, or code walk-throughs.
4.3 Wrap-Up (Closing, 1–2 Lines)
Purpose:
Reinforce the core takeaway and invite learners to continue into the lesson.
Requirements:
1–2 short sentences.
Summarize why the skill matters.
Gently encourage continued learning or practice (e.g., “In this lesson, you’ll start building that skill step by step.”).
Avoid promises that cannot be guaranteed (e.g., guaranteed jobs or salaries).
5. Content Integrity and Factual Accuracy
“Why” vignettes must be truthful, non-exaggerated, and evidence-respecting.
Authors must not:
Invent or exaggerate statistics, facts, or case studies.
Attribute quotes to real people without verifiable sources.
Use vague or generic success stories that cannot be substantiated.
When referring to:
Trends (e.g., demand for a skill).
Impact (e.g., productivity improvements).
Outcomes (e.g., career opportunities).
Authors should:
Keep statements general and accurate (“This skill is widely used in data analysis roles”) unless specific, verifiable evidence is available.
Avoid precise claims (“This skill will double your salary”) unless supported by reliable data and aligned to broader content standards.
If more detailed data or specific claims are used, they should be:
Aligned with the factual accuracy expectations described elsewhere in the Level 1 spec.
Based on reputable sources and internally reviewed where appropriate.
6. Coursera Brand Voice (Who We Are)
All “Why” vignettes must embody the Coursera brand voice. Authors should deliberately check their scripts against these four attributes:
Magnetic
Use active voice and confident, straightforward statements.
Spark curiosity about what the learner will be able to do.
Keep the pacing energetic and focused.
Emphasize the opportunity that comes from learning the skill.
Uplifting
Proceed from a positive, encouraging stance.
Connect small steps (this lesson) to big goals (career advancement, new possibilities).
Emphasize what learners can do and how they can grow.
Focus on beneficial outcomes, not fear or scarcity.
Trusted
Be accurate and thoughtful; do not over-promise.
Avoid jargon and ambiguity; explain ideas plainly.
Be inclusive in examples and scenarios.
Maintain a consistent, professional tone throughout.
Inventive
Where relevant, highlight:
Partnerships, collaborations, or innovations (without turning the vignette into marketing).
Major shifts or innovations in the field the learner should know about.
Show learners how the field is changing and how learning this skill positions them for the future.
7. Coursera Brand Tone (How We Communicate)
Tone is how the script sounds to learners. It should adapt to context while remaining true to Coursera’s personality.
Clear and Confident
Directly answer the learner’s core questions:
“What is this about?”
“Why should I care?”
Show how taking action (starting the lesson, practicing the skill) leads to new opportunities.
Connect the message to concrete outcomes (e.g., solving a specific type of problem at work).
Conversational
Use natural, human language.
Be concise; avoid overly complex sentences and filler.
Sound like a supportive expert speaking directly to the learner.
Empathetic and Motivating
Acknowledge that learning something new can feel challenging.
Avoid:
Negative or shaming language (“If you don’t know this, you’re behind.”).
Colloquialisms, idioms, or expressions that may not translate well globally.
Words or phrases with offensive or problematic origins.
Encourage learners and make them feel capable of progressing.
8. Language and Accessibility Requirements
To support a global and diverse learner base:
Reading level:
The opening hook must be written at or below a 5th-grade reading level.
The remainder of the script should aim for clear, accessible language suitable for a broad, international audience.
Clarity:
Avoid unexplained acronyms or specialized jargon.
When a technical term is necessary, provide a simple, high-level explanation.
Inclusivity:
Use diverse, inclusive examples and scenarios.
Avoid stereotypes about roles, regions, or backgrounds.
9. Style Do’s and Don’ts
9.1 Do
Do:
Use “you” to speak directly to learners.
Ground motivation in real tasks, problems, and roles.
Use brief, vivid anecdotes from realistic industry experience.
Show empathy (“I’ve been there too”) when appropriate.
Offer meaningful, concise advice (“Here’s what I wish I’d known sooner.”).
9.2 Don’t
Do not:
Invent or exaggerate stats, quotes, or outcomes.
Use generic, unverifiable success stories.
Rely on hype or fear (“If you don’t learn this, you’ll be left behind.”).
Use phrases like “let’s dive in,” “deep dive,” or similar overused metaphors in the script.
Overcomplicate the message; the vignette should simplify and humanize the “why,” not add cognitive load.
10. Authoring Process and Checklist
Authors (or vendor partners) creating “Why” vignettes should follow this process:
Clarify the Learning Objective
Identify the specific skill or topic this vignette introduces.
Write down one clear sentence that completes:
“After this lesson, learners will be able to…”
Collect Context
Review the associated:
“What” reading(s).
“How” demonstration(s).
“Apply” and “Assess” activities.
Determine how the vignette can bridge learners from their current state to caring about this upcoming content.
Draft the Hook
Write 1–2 short sentences explaining why this matters in the simplest terms possible.
Confirm hook reads at or below 5th-grade level and uses “you” where natural.
Build the Body
Connect the skill to:
Job tasks or real-world activities.
Industry or field importance.
Outcomes learners care about (e.g., efficiency, creativity, impact).
Incorporate at least one of:
End-result framing.
Brief, authentic anecdote.
Empathetic reflection.
Actionable advice.
Keep the total script within ~200–450 words.
Write the Wrap-Up
Summarize the main “why” in 1–2 lines.
Invite learners forward:
“In the next items, you’ll start putting this into practice.”
Review for Voice, Tone, and Accuracy
Check against Sections 5–9 for brand alignment.
Remove any unverified facts or implied guarantees.
Simplify sentences for clarity and global accessibility.
Final Self-Check
 Duration target (1–3 minutes) and length (~200–450 words) are reasonable.
 The vignette clearly answers: “Why should the learner care?”
 Hook is short, simple, and learner-facing.
 Body focuses on motivation and real-world relevance, not step-by-step instruction.
 Wrap-up reinforces the takeaway and encourages continued learning.
 Script is standalone and makes sense even if reused in another course/program context.

“How” Screencast Videos – Level 1 Content Specifications
1. Purpose and Role in WWHAA
“How” screencast videos support the How phase of the WWHAA design footprint. They focus on procedural knowledge—showing learners how to do something in a concrete tool, environment, or workflow.
These screencasts:
Demonstrate step-by-step processes learners need to perform.
Bridge the gap between conceptual understanding (“What”) and hands-on practice (“Apply”).
Model good practices and techniques in authentic tools and interfaces.
All “How” screencasts must comply with the specifications below in addition to all other Level 1 requirements (Skill-First, Standalone & Stackable, WWHAA, accessibility, etc.).
2. Definition and Screencast Types
A “How” screencast is a screen-capture-based instructional video (no on-camera presenter) that demonstrates a workflow, process, or technique in a specific tool or environment.
There are two supported types of “How” screencasts:
2.1 Demonstration Tutorial
Purpose:
Show learners what to do while they watch, without expecting them to perform actions simultaneously.
Pacing:
Smooth, continuous flow; minimal deliberate pauses for learner activity.
Language:
“I’ll show you how to…” style, describing actions the instructor performs on screen.
Typical duration:
~3–5 minutes.
Focus:
Clarity and completeness of the demonstration; learners can later replicate steps in their own time.
2.2 Follow-Along Tutorial
Purpose:
Guide learners to perform tasks as they watch, step by step.
Pacing:
Deliberate, with clear transitions and explicit pause points for learners to complete actions.
Language:
“Now you’ll…” or “Now you…” style, with direct instructions and prompts.
Typical duration:
~5–7 minutes for the same content that would fit into a shorter demonstration.
Focus:
Detailed, step-by-step guidance with explicit practice intervals built into the video.
Each “How” screencast must be clearly designed as either:
a Demonstration Tutorial, or
a Follow-Along Tutorial,
and must follow the requirements associated with that type.
3. Length, Scope, and Splitting Content
3.1 Script Length
Typical script length (spoken narration only):
Minimum: ~300 words
Maximum: ~900 words
Character range for narration (including spaces): ~1,800–5,400 characters.
As a guideline:
Demonstration tutorials usually fall around 300–600 words.
Follow-along tutorials usually fall around 400–900 words, due to additional instructions and pause cues.
Character guidance by type:
Demonstration tutorials: ~1,800–3,600 characters.
Follow-along tutorials: ~2,400–5,400 characters.
3.2 Video Duration
Demonstration: ~3–5 minutes.
Follow-along: ~5–7 minutes.
3.3 Scope and Splitting
If the process or workflow is too extensive for a single 3–7 minute screencast:
Authors should split the content into multiple screencasts, typically 2–5 minutes each.
Each screencast should:
Have a clear, focused goal (e.g., “Connecting to the data source,” “Configuring basic settings,” “Publishing the report”).
Include its own short hook and wrap-up, even if part of a mini-series.
When planning, outline the workflow and identify natural breakpoints where a learner’s sense of completion or milestone is clear.
4. Critical Accessibility Requirements
“How” screencasts must be fully usable for learners who are relying on audio, captions, and assistive technologies. This requires explicit narration of all on-screen actions.
4.1 Verbalization of On-Screen Actions
For every screencast:
Every on-screen action must be verbalized in the spoken script, including:
Cursor movements that matter to the task (e.g., “I’m moving to the Home tab in the ribbon.”).
All clicks and selections (e.g., “I’ll click the ‘Run’ button in the top-right corner.”).
Typing actions (e.g., “Now I’m typing SELECT * FROM sales into the query editor.”).
Visual changes that affect understanding (e.g., “A new panel appears on the right showing our filter options.”).
No action should appear in the planned visual sequence (screen recording) without a corresponding description in the spoken script.
This ensures that learners who cannot see the screen can still follow the logic and structure of the task.
4.2 Verbalization of Pause Points (Follow-Along Tutorials)
For follow-along tutorials, every planned pause for learner action must be clearly verbalized, including:
When to pause:
“Pause the video now…”
What to do:
“…and create a new worksheet named ‘Summary’.”
How they’ll know they’ve completed the task correctly:
“You’ll know you’re ready to continue when you see the ‘Summary’ sheet listed alongside your other tabs.”
When to resume:
“When you’re done, resume the video to continue.”
Pause points should be used:
For extended actions that take more than a few seconds.
For practice segments where learners apply the skill in their own context (e.g., in their own document, dataset, or environment).
Quick actions that take 1–2 seconds (e.g., a single button click) typically do not require a formal pause directive, as learners can follow along in real time.
5. Script and Content Structure
All “How” screencasts must follow a clear three-part structure: Hook, Body, and Wrap-up.
5.1 Hook (1–2 Sentences)
Opening phrase requirement:
Always begin the spoken script with “In this video…”
(Do not use “Today” as an opener.)
Purpose:
Briefly explain why this specific procedure or workflow matters.
Set expectations for what learners will be able to do by the end.
Characteristics:
1–2 short, punchy sentences.
Simple, accessible language (similar expectations as for “Why” vignettes, though not strictly under 5th-grade reading level overall).
Directly address the learner: “In this video, you’ll learn how to…”
5.2 Body (Step-by-Step Demonstration)
The body of the screencast should:
Present a logical, sequential set of steps.
For each step:
Explain what the step accomplishes and why it’s needed.
Describe exactly what appears on screen and what the instructor is doing (for demonstration types).
For follow-along:
Provide clear instructions for what the learner should do.
Use pause points for extended actions (see Section 4.2).
For Demonstration Tutorials:
Focus on:
Showing the full process with clear narration.
Maintaining a smooth pace without frequent pauses.
Suitable for:
Introducing a workflow that learners will revisit.
Complex or multi-stage tasks where learners first need an overview.
For Follow-Along Tutorials:
Focus on:
Guiding learners through the workflow as they do it.
Incorporating planned opportunities for practice.
Require:
More explicit instructions and cue phrases (“Now you’ll…”).
Clear guidance at each pause point.
5.3 Wrap-up (1–2 Lines)
Reinforce the key takeaway:
What the learner can now do.
How this connects to their broader goals or to the next course component.
Encourage continued learning:
“Next, you’ll use this setup in a hands-on assignment to analyze your own data.”
Keep it brief and focused on outcomes and next steps.
6. Step Design and Pause Point Guidance
6.1 Quick vs. Extended Actions
To avoid overwhelming learners:
Quick actions (1–2 seconds):
Example: clicking a tab, opening a menu, toggling a checkbox.
Learners can follow in real time if desired.
No formal “pause now” directive needed.
Extended actions (more than a few seconds):
Example: writing a paragraph of code, formatting multiple elements, configuring a complex dialog.
Should be paired with an explicit pause directive and clear instructions.
6.2 Follow-Along Tutorials: Practice Segments
In follow-along tutorials:
Use practice segments where learners apply the skill in their own context (e.g., their own project or document).
Each practice segment must:
Provide clear instructions on what to do.
Indicate how learners can verify success.
Remind learners to resume the video once ready.
7. Visual and Technical Requirements
“How” screencasts are screen-based: the instructor does not appear on camera. Visual clarity and accessibility are critical.
7.1 Screen Capture and Layout
Resolution:
1920×1080 (16:9 aspect ratio) is recommended for most screencasts.
Cursor:
Use a clearly visible cursor.
Clicks should be easy to see (e.g., subtle highlight or ripple), especially when interacting with small UI elements.
Text size and readability:
On-screen text (e.g., tool UI, labels, code, annotations) should be large enough to read on smaller devices:
Aim for a minimum of 16pt equivalent for body text in slides or overlays.
Avoid clutter; focus the learner’s view on relevant areas (use zoom when needed).
Zoom and focus:
Use zoom or tight cropping for small or dense UI components.
Avoid rapid camera moves or flashing changes.
7.2 Visual Accessibility
Color contrast:
Ensure a minimum color contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text or important UI elements presented as part of instruction.
Use of color:
Do not rely on color alone to convey meaning (e.g., “click the red button”).
Supplement with shapes, labels, or annotations as needed.
Captions and transcripts:
All screencasts must support accurate captions and transcripts, aligned with the spoken script and including narration of visual changes.
7.3 Code Visualization (When Applicable)
When demonstrating code:
Use a monospaced font with adequate size and line spacing for readability.
Use syntax highlighting that:
Distinguishes key elements (functions, strings, keywords, comments).
Maintains adequate contrast and accessibility.
Consider showing:
Code and its output side-by-side where helpful (e.g., split screen).
Narration should:
Verbally identify and explain important parts of the code.
Clearly describe what is being typed or changed.
8. Coursera Brand Voice and Tone
“How” screencasts must reflect the same brand voice and tone as other course elements.
8.1 Voice (Who We Are)
Magnetic
Use active voice and confident language.
Foster curiosity by pointing out interesting results or patterns learners will see on screen.
Keep pacing dynamic but not rushed.
Uplifting
Emphasize learners’ progress as they complete steps.
Connect small technical wins to larger goals (e.g., “This may seem small, but it’s the foundation of a reliable pipeline.”).
Trusted
Provide accurate, precise instructions.
Avoid jargon where possible; explain necessary terms clearly.
Use realistic examples; do not exaggerate capabilities or outcomes.
Inventive
When appropriate, show innovative uses of tools or workflows.
Highlight partnerships or relevant research visually and verbally where it genuinely supports learning.
8.2 Tone (How We Communicate)
Clear and Confident
Answer core viewer questions:
“What am I doing?”
“Why am I doing it this way?”
Connect each step to a desired result or outcome.
Conversational
Use natural, supportive language (“You’ll notice…”, “If you make a mistake, you can…”).
Be concise and avoid unnecessary tangents.
Empathetic and Motivating
Acknowledge that learners might make errors or need to replay steps.
Avoid negative or shaming language.
Encourage learners (“If this feels unfamiliar now, that’s normal. With a few repetitions, these steps will start to feel natural.”).
9. What to Avoid
To maintain quality and consistency, authors of “How” screencasts must avoid:
Inventing or exaggerating facts, statistics, or examples about tools or outcomes.
Including unverified claims or generic, vague success stories.
Using overused phrases like “let’s dive in” or “deep dive” in introductions.
Overcomplicating the message with cluttered visuals or too many on-screen elements at once.
Rapid screen transitions without explanation or context.
Showing cursor movements or UI actions without narrating them.
Referring to an on-screen presenter (the instructor is not visible).
Starting with “Today…” instead of “In this video…”.
Designing follow-along tutorials that rush through steps without adequate time or clear pause instructions.
10. Authoring Process and Checklist
When designing a “How” screencast, authors should follow this process:
Define the Goal and Type
Identify the specific skill or task learners will complete by the end.
Decide whether the screencast is a Demonstration or Follow-Along tutorial.
Scope the Content
Outline the steps involved.
Confirm whether the workflow fits comfortably into a 3–7 minute video.
If not, plan to split into multiple shorter screencasts.
Draft the Script
Write a brief hook that begins with “In this video…” and states the goal in simple terms.
Script each step:
What is happening on screen.
What the narrator says.
Why the step matters.
Include explicit pause instructions for follow-along tutorials where needed.
Plan Visuals and Technical Requirements
Choose the tool/environment to show.
Identify areas that will require zooming or special highlighting.
Ensure fonts, colors, and layout meet accessibility and readability standards.
Review for Accessibility and Brand Alignment
Confirm that every on-screen action is verbalized.
Check that instructions are clear, inclusive, and non-jargon heavy.
Verify brand voice and tone (Magnetic, Uplifting, Trusted, Inventive).
Final Self-Check
 Screencast type (Demonstration or Follow-Along) is explicit and consistent.
 Length and scope are appropriate (3–7 minutes; ~300–900 words).
 Hook starts with “In this video…” and clearly states the skill/task.
 All important actions and visual changes are described in narration.
 Follow-along tutorials include clear pause instructions for extended actions.
 Visual and technical setup meets accessibility and readability requirements.
 Screencast is standalone and reusable in multiple course contexts.
“What” Instructional Videos
Although we’re moving away from reliance on traditional instructional videos in our design footprint, there may be places where didactic videos make sense, such as to introduce key ideas or explain concepts. Here’s a template for creating these types of instructional videos.

Hook
Aim for at least 3-5 sentences, or up to two paragraphs where appropriate. 
See “How to Write Engaging Opening Hooks” for best practices and generative AI prompts to help with hook development. 

Example
Think of traditional education as a conveyor belt, moving at a fixed pace regardless of individual needs. Some learners fall off, unable to keep up, while others are eager to race ahead. Now, imagine learning as a choose-your-own-adventure book, where learners turn the page when they’re ready. That's mastery learning on Coursera.
Introduction
Introduce the topic of the video and what will be learned.
When discussing what will be learned, you might highlight how you’ll go about teaching it or what case studies or tools might be used.
Keep it short, concise and engaging.
This is effectively an extension of the hook above and is often intermingled with the hook.

Example
In this video, we'll explore how Coursera's mastery learning approach offers a way to help every learner succeed. We’ll do this by explaining what mastery learning is and showing you how it’s built into Coursera learning experiences. 
Learning Objective(s)
Cover no more than 1-3 tightly connected objectives per video.
If you’re having trouble keeping a video below 7 minutes, focus on a single objective. 
Start each learning objective with a specific, measurable Bloom’s action verb. 

Example
By the end of this video, you will be able to: 
Explain how Coursera courses draw from mastery learning principles.
Apply mastery learning principles to course design and development. 
Body
Break down the topic into 2-4 key points or subtopics that support the video’s learning objective(s).
Organize the content in a clear, sequential manner that builds understanding step-by-step.
For each main point, offer concrete examples, case studies, or demonstrations to illustrate concepts.
Provide enough detail to thoroughly explain concepts, but avoid unnecessary tangents.
Include smooth transitions between main points to maintain flow and coherence.
Use rhetorical questions, analogies, or in-video questions to keep viewers interested and actively thinking.
Ensure each part of the body directly supports the video’s stated learning objective(s).

Example
[Key concept or point] The main point behind mastery learning is to master a topic before proceeding to the next topic. This model embraces failure as a form of feedback for learning. Rather than “punish” a learner for failing to understand something, the learner is given the opportunity to try again. [Illustration of concept with concrete examples] Here’s a visualization of how mastery learning can function on Coursera. …
Summary
Highlight key ideas or takeaways. 
Draw out the implications of the ideas taught.
Do not simply restate the learning objective(s).
Keep this short, concise and useful.

Example
In this video, we examined Coursera’s approach to mastery learning. Mastery learning:
Promotes a deeper understanding of the subject matter by ensuring learners master each concept before moving forward. 
Encourages a positive learning environment where failure is seen as a part of the learning process, not a setback. 
Provides personalized learning experiences by providing informative feedback based on individual performance on formative activities. 
Call to Action
Outline the next steps learners should take to apply what they’ve learned.
Start sentences with strong imperative verbs (“Start…”, “Try…”).
Keep this short, concise and powerful (one paragraph of 3-5 sentences).
Be relevant to the video content and learning goals.
Create a sense of urgency or excitement.
Be specific and actionable.
See “How to Write Effective Calls to Action” for best practices and generative AI prompts to help with hook development. 

Example
Now that you’ve learned about mastery learning, you’re ready to apply it to your course design. Start by developing a course outline with both formative and summative assessments. Then consider what kind of feedback learners may need on the formative assessments to successfully demonstrate mastery on the summative assessments.

Video Visuals
Minimize Text and Bullets
Remove repetitive slide titles (since these are unnecessary and simply add words)
Avoid nested sub-bullets (since this gets busy fast and indicates too much text)
Use a clean new slide for each new topic (since this helps cue the learner’s attention without overburdening them with a build-up prior text)

If a slide has more than 5-7 words on it, look for opportunities to condense it.
Learning objective slides will be longer (but don’t let text encroach on the lower fifth)  
Quotes that use (short) text blocks will be longer (but use sparingly) 
Using Text in Visuals
Text shown on screen should always be verbalized in the presentation. But everything in the verbal presentation does not need to be shown on screen. 
Focus on showing key words on screen (rather than sentences).
Don’t let the on-screen text mimic a teleprompter (it’s for the audience not the presenter).
Why Images Are Better Than Text
Images are always better than text. Why? We have two channels for processing information: linguistic and visual. The linguistic channel includes both written and spoken language, so presenting too much of both at the same time clogs up this channel, increasing the cognitive load. But we can process spoken words (linguistic channel) and visual images (visual channel) without that problem. This is why a good image/graphic that complements the verbal presentation is more effective than on-screen text. So, when using text, use selective text as if the text were images (something learners can “view” without needing to “read” per se). 
Visuals Best Practices
Use compelling visuals that complement the verbal explanation and support key concepts 
Minimize text/bullet points and maximize visual imagery
Limit text where you can
Introduce one bullet point at a time
Incorporate visual variety to keep learners engaged
Beware complex graphics; cue the learner to the portion of graphics where you want them to place their attention (e.g., magnification, highlighting)
Avoid putting vital content in the lower fifth of the screen so it won't interfere with subtitles
Keep slides in motion (don’t spend too much time on a single slide)
Follow WCAG guidelines for accessibility regarding color contrast, information display, etc.
Before/After Examples
Here are examples of slides with the originals on the left and the improved slides on the right.



Designing for Mobile Devices
Make sure slide text is at least 20-pt font, so your slides remain readable for learners on mobile devices
Use a widescreen aspect ratio (16:9) for your slides

Coursera Best Practices for Creating Engaging and Effective Instructional Videos (ERC)
Video Production
Characteristics of Quality Videos
Instructor Presence. The instructor presents with energy and genuine interest in the subject matter. Their approach is conversational, ensuring the delivery is animated and engaging.

Lighting. Lighting is appropriate so that the instructor is well-lit. Three-point lighting is commonly used to achieve this, ensuring that the subject is visible without excessive shadows.

Audio Quality. A quality microphone is used. Audio background noise and echo is omitted to ensure clear speech. 

Intro/Outro. Include partner (or Coursera for Coursera-owned) bumpers with copyright information at the beginning and end of the first and last video of the course. During this time, music should play while the bumpers are on screen.

Transitions. Transitions between segments in the video must be seamless without causing abrupt or jarring changes in the visual experience.
Readings
Reading items typically consist of original work written specifically for the course, following these best practices:
Keep readings short, concise, and focused just like videos
Use headings and subheadings to visually chunk ideas into sections
Use visuals/graphics to help learners conceptualize complex concepts
Use screenshots to illustrate instructions for software applications
Refer to and fully explain charts, tables, and graphics in the text
Keep the language conversational and accessible
Address the learner directly (“you”)
Define technical terms and spell out acronyms
State the learning objective at the beginning
Summarize the key takeaways at the end
Provide alt text for all images and complex diagrams
Follow WCAG guidelines for accessibility
“What” Readings – Level 1 Content Specifications
1. Purpose and Role in WWHAA
“What” readings support the What phase of the WWHAA design footprint. They provide the core declarative knowledge learners need to understand what a skill is, why it matters, and how it connects to the module’s learning objectives.
These readings:
Focus on facts, concepts, terminology, and processes.
Lay the conceptual foundation for the hands-on work learners will do in the How, Apply, and Assess phases.
Are written to be standalone items that can be reused across courses and programs.
All “What” readings must comply with the specifications below in addition to all other Level 1 requirements (Skill-first, Standalone & Stackable, WWHAA, accessibility, etc.).
2. Definition and Scope
A “What” reading is a course item that:
Explains core concepts and definitions aligned to a specific Skill and its Skill Expressions.
Emphasizes declarative knowledge (what something is, how it works, what its components are).
Uses didactic exposition supported by examples, diagrams, and/or simple process descriptions.
Prepares learners for guided practice (How), independent application (Apply), and assessment (Assess).
“What” readings are not:
Step-by-step “click this button” walkthroughs (those belong in How/Apply).
Opinion pieces, thought leadership, or marketing content.
Primary assessment vehicles (though they may include simple reflection prompts).
3. Length Requirements
All “What” readings must meet the following word count constraints:
Required length:
Minimum: 800 words
Maximum: 1,500 words
Character range (including spaces): ~4,800–9,000 characters, using ~6 characters per word as the planning baseline.
The word count applies to the main reading content only (from title through Conclusion).
The KEY STATS AND SOURCES FOR REVIEWER’S USE section (see Section 7) is not included in this word count.
If a single reading would exceed 1,500 words, authors must:
Split the content into two or more readings, each adhering to the 800–1,500 word requirement.
Ensure each reading is coherent and standalone, with its own Introduction and Conclusion.
4. Structure and Formatting Requirements
All “What” readings must follow a consistent, predictable structure to support reuse and learner navigation.
4.1 Title and Heading Hierarchy
The reading title must:
Appear at the top of the item.
Use a level 1 heading (H1).
Follow the format:
TITLE: Your Title Here
Use the following heading hierarchy for the body:
H2 (##) for all main sections.
H3 (###) for subsections.
H4 (####) for further subdivisions if needed.
4.2 Required Section Structure
Each “What” reading must include at least the following structure:
Introduction (required, first main section)
Header: ## Introduction
Content:
A short, punchy hook (1–2 sentences) that connects to learner goals, real-world relevance, or a compelling question.
A brief introduction to the learning objectives, explaining what learners will understand by the end of the reading (in plain language).
Body Sections (one or more main sections, H2)
Each main section uses a descriptive H2 heading, not generic labels like “Body” or “Main Content”.
Authors should structure content into logical chunks that:
Introduce core concepts.
Explain key terms and relationships.
Provide examples and, where helpful, simple step-wise descriptions of processes.
Conclusion (required, final main section)
Header: ## Conclusion
Content:
A concise wrap-up of key takeaways.
A forward-looking note that connects the reading to:
Upcoming items in the module (e.g., hands-on activities, assessments) without relying on fragile cross-references.
Practical next steps learners can take (e.g., “In the upcoming activity, you’ll…” framed in a standalone-friendly way).
4.3 Template
Authors should use the following template as a baseline for all “What” readings (adapt wording as needed, but maintain structure):
# TITLE: [Title Goes Here]

## Introduction  
[Hook goes here in 1–2 sentences…]

[Learning objective introduction goes here: what the learner will understand or be able to explain after this reading…]

## [Main Heading 1]  
[Content that develops one major concept or cluster of related concepts…]

## [Main Heading 2]  
[Content that adds further concepts, examples, or perspectives…]

… (add additional main sections as needed, all H2) …

## Conclusion  
[Wrap up key ideas, highlight the most important takeaways, and connect briefly to how this understanding will support learners in practice or in upcoming course activities.]

5. Style and Accessibility Requirements
All “What” readings must follow a consistent style that aligns with Coursera’s brand and supports accessibility for a global learner base.
5.1 Language and Readability
Address learners directly using “you”.
Use conversational, plain language while remaining professional.
Avoid or explain:
Jargon, idioms, and culture-specific references.
Domain-specific terminology that has not been defined.
Define all technical terms and acronyms on first use:
Spell out the full term followed by the acronym in parentheses, then use the acronym thereafter.
5.2 Structure and Lists
Use headings to chunk content into logical, scannable sections.
Use bulleted or numbered lists when:
Presenting multiple related points.
Outlining steps in a process.
Avoid extremely long paragraphs; break up dense text to support skimming and comprehension.
5.3 Accessibility
All content must comply with WCAG-aligned accessibility practices, including:
Clear heading structure as specified above.
Sufficient contrast and legible font sizes in any embedded images or screenshots.
Avoidance of conveying meaning by color alone.
Any non-text element (images, diagrams, charts) must include:
Alt text recommendations (see Section 6).
A textual explanation in the reading itself when the visual is essential to understanding.
6. Visual Elements (Images, Diagrams, Tables)
Visuals in “What” readings should be instructionally necessary, not decorative.
6.1 When to Use Visuals
Use visuals to:
Clarify complex relationships or systems.
Illustrate stepwise processes or workflows.
Provide a conceptual overview that is hard to convey solely in prose.
Do not add visuals purely to “dress up” the reading.
6.2 Alt Text and Descriptions
For every non-decorative image or diagram, authors must:
Provide alt text recommendations that:
Convey the essential instructional information.
Avoid redundancy with nearby text; instead, complement it.
Ensure that the main narrative text:
Explains the visual’s relevance and helps learners interpret it.
6.3 Tables
Tables must be:
Properly formatted with header rows and meaningful column labels.
Used primarily for:
Comparisons (e.g., feature vs feature).
Structured data that benefits from tabular layout.
Avoid using tables solely for visual layout or design.
7. Factual Accuracy, Stats, and Sources
“What” readings must be accurate, current where relevant, and verifiable.
7.1 Key Stats and Sources Section
Each “What” reading must include a section at the end titled:
# KEY STATS AND SOURCES FOR REVIEWER’S USE
This section:
Is intended for internal review and quality assurance, not as learner-facing content.
Must list:
Any statistics, quantitative claims, or critical factual statements used in the reading.
For each, provide:
A brief description of the claim.
The source name, URL, and publication date (or “n.d.” if no date is available).
Is not counted in the 800–1,500 word requirement for the reading itself.
7.2 Use of Sources
Prefer:
High-quality, reputable sources (research articles, official documentation, industry reports, government or NGO data).
Up-to-date information for any time-sensitive topics.
Avoid:
Unsupported claims, vague generalizations, or unverifiable anecdotes.
When referencing Coursera proprietary research, clearly label it as such in the KEY STATS AND SOURCES section.
8. Coursera Brand Voice (Who We Are)
All “What” readings must embody Coursera’s brand voice. Authors should check their drafts against the four characteristics below:
Magnetic
Use active voice and confident, straightforward statements.
Spark curiosity by connecting concepts to real-world problems and opportunities.
Show passion for learning and highlight the “why” behind concepts.
Uplifting
Proceed from a positive, empowering stance.
Connect small wins (understanding a concept) to bigger goals (career growth, new opportunities).
Emphasize what learners can do next, not what they lack.
Trusted
Be accurate and appropriately detailed, avoiding overclaiming.
Avoid jargon and ambiguity; clarify terms and assumptions.
Be inclusive:
Use examples that reflect diverse people, industries, and contexts.
Avoid stereotypes and biased framing.
Inventive
Where appropriate, highlight relevant:
Partnerships.
Innovations in the field.
Research findings (including Coursera research, if available).
Show how the domain is evolving and how learners can stay current.
9. Coursera Brand Tone (How We Communicate)
Tone should reflect our personality in context of the learner’s journey.
Clear and Confident
Answer core questions directly: What is this? Why does it matter? How does it work at a high level?
Connect content to concrete outcomes (skills, tasks, career relevance).
Avoid hedging language unless uncertainty is important to acknowledge.
Conversational
Use natural, human language:
Contractions are acceptable where appropriate.
Avoid overly formal or academic phrasing.
Be concise; remove unnecessary filler and repetition.
Empathetic and Motivating
Assume learners may be:
New to the topic.
Balancing other commitments.
Learning in a second or third language.
Avoid:
Negative or shaming language.
Colloquialisms, idioms, or terms with offensive or problematic origins.
10. Authoring Process and Submission Checklist
Authors (or vendor partners) creating “What” readings should follow this process:
Identify Core Learning Objectives
Confirm which Skill and Skill Expressions this reading supports.
Draft 1–3 clear, concise learning objectives for the reading (even if not shown verbatim).
Craft the Introduction
Write a 1–2 sentence hook that resonates with learner needs or a real-world scenario.
Add a brief overview of what learners will understand by the end.
Organize the Body
Break content into 2–4 main sections (H2) with descriptive headings.
Use H3/H4 sparingly for logical subtopics.
Ensure the total length (Intro + body + Conclusion) is 800–1,500 words.
Write the Conclusion
Summarize key takeaways in a concise, learner-friendly way.
Connect the concepts to how they’ll support upcoming practice or real-world application.
Add Visuals (Optional but Recommended When Helpful)
Include diagrams, images, or tables where they clearly aid understanding.
Provide alt text recommendations and explanatory narrative in the body.
Review for Brand Voice, Tone, and Accessibility
Check against Sections 5, 8, and 9.
Ensure technical terms are defined and examples are inclusive.
Document Sources
Add a # KEY STATS AND SOURCES FOR REVIEWER’S USE section after the main content.
List each key factual or statistical claim with source, URL, and date.
Confirm this section is maintained outside the main word count.
Final Self-Check Before Submission
 Title uses TITLE: and H1.
 Sections follow required hierarchy (## Introduction, body sections as H2, ## Conclusion).
 Word count (Introduction through Conclusion) is 800–1,500 words.
 Reading is standalone and understandable if reused in a different course/program context.
 KEY STATS AND SOURCES section is present, clear, and not counted in the word total.
Embedding Articles or Resources in Readings
You can also embed articles/resources into readings for download assuming you have the rights to do so while following these guidelines:
Any content that belongs to others requires legal permissions to use and distribute for profit
Ensure downloads are provided in a format that all learners can access (e.g., PDF)
Linking to Open-Access Articles or Resources in Readings
Readings may also include links to open-access articles/resources, following these guidelines: 
External content should be reserved for optional resources for further exploration and should not be part of the primary learning path (i.e., learners won’t be tested on them)
When linking to an external article, ensure it can be accessed by learners around the world without needing to cross through a paywall
Include a brief introduction to provide context for external links so learners know where the link is taking them and why (i.e., don’t simply include a hyperlink in an otherwise blank reading item)
Ensure external links are reputable, credible, and accurate, and represent content the partner would feel comfortable sharing with learners.
Ensure external links are up to date, keeping in mind that links to external websites may change or break
Avoid external content that contains ads or elements that distract from the main content you want learners to read
Always use links rather than iframes, unless you have permissions to embed the content
To aid screen readers, hyperlink specific titles for links instead of using the full URL
Avoid Use of the Resources Section
What is the Resources Section of a Course?
The Resources section in Coursera courses is designed for supplemental materials that learners can access from the course home. These materials are not part of the main learning path and are not required to complete the course. Examples might include:

A glossary of important terms
Study tips for success
Installation instructions for required software
Reference texts, formulas, or diagrams (e.g., a periodic table)

Learners access these materials from the Resources page of the course, and instructors can choose whether resources are visible there or only accessible via direct links.


Guidance for Course Development
✅ Do upload files directly into a learning item in the main course material.
❌ Don’t add or link to files in the Resources section.

To facilitate modularity when building new content, do not add files to the Resources section. Instead, always place files directly into a learning item within the main learning path (e.g., a reading, video, or assignment).

This ensures that:

All materials remain accessible to learners when content is reused in new courses or skills paths.
Files are tied to the appropriate point in the learner journey, rather than living outside the course structure.
Hyperlinks will not break if a course is cloned or retrofitted into a new program.

If you want to provide supplemental reference material, create a dedicated learning item (e.g., a reading) within the course itself (e.g., end of module). This keeps the materials organized within the learning path itself and ensures learners always have access, regardless of where the course is delivered.
Multiple Choice Quiz Questions
You can set up both practice and graded quizzes in an Assignment item. Tailor feedback for each answer option. The feedback provided on practice quizzes should differ from the feedback provided on graded quizzes, as described below. 
Practice Assignment (Quiz) Feedback
On practice quizzes, provide option-level feedback that explains why each choice is correct or incorrect and let learners know what the correct answer should be. Explaining why each choice is correct or incorrect on practice (formative) quizzes heads off misconceptions and reinforces the development of accurate mental models. Plus, we’ve found from our own research that adding meaningful practice leads to a larger percentage of learners progressing through the course, helping both with understanding and motivation. 


Graded Assignment (Quiz) Feedback
On graded quizzes, provide option-level feedback that refers learners to relevant review items (e.g., video titles or topics) rather than revealing the answers. Mastery learning requires learners to pass each graded quiz to complete the course. Learners may retake a graded quiz until they succeed. So, we want to provide feedback to guide their studying in between attempts. Pointing learners to appropriate review items will help them focus their studying before retaking the quiz.


Question Writing Tips
Avoid negative phrasings
Avoid ambiguous wordings
Make use of different question types (e.g., single correct, multiple correct)
Multiple choice options should be authentic and plausible
Draw from actual concepts learners have encountered
Repeat key terms from the question in the answers (rather than using demonstrative pronouns such as “this” or “that”) for clarity
Question Variations
Question variations are important on graded assignments (quizzes) to prevent learners from encountering the same questions on retakes. This approach elevates the rigor of assignments by ensuring learners genuinely understand the material instead of memorizing answers to specific questions.

For courses seeking American Council on Education (ACE) credit recommendation, each graded question must have three unique variations. For example, a graded assignment with 10 quiz questions would require a total of 30 questions (3 variation per question stem). 

Entry-level Professional Certificates undergoing ACE Credit Recommendation must meet these standards to ensure rigor and academic integrity on graded multiple-choice quizzes (but the requirements may be met after launch):

3 variations per question
Attempt rate = 3 attempts/day
Submissions per attempt = 1
Time limit = 5 minutes/question

Guidelines for Writing Effective Question Variations

Same Learning Objective, Unique Questions. Each variation should assess the same learning objective, using questions with a different approach, scenario, or data point, while maintaining the core focus.

Diverse Question Types. Use a mix of question types (e.g., multiple-choice single correct, multiple correct, true/false) to evaluate the same learning objective from different angles.

Beyond Rephrasing. Go beyond minor wording changes. Consider alternative ways to approach the learning objective, presenting it in a new context or requiring a different type of thinking.
