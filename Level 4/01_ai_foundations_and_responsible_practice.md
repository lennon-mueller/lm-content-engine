# Course 1: AI Foundations and Responsible Practice

## Course Purpose
Equip learners with the core vocabulary, math intuition, and responsible AI mindset needed to navigate the rest of the specialization. Emphasize curiosity, humility, and global inclusivity while grounding every concept in real workflows.

## Target Skills
- Explain core AI/ML concepts (algorithms, data, training, inference) in plain language.
- Describe the AI project lifecycle using WWHAA framing and Google-recommended checkpoints.
- Identify responsible AI principles and apply them to simple scenarios.
- Collaborate with teammates using shared terminology and lightweight documentation.

## Course Architecture (4 modules)
1. **Orientation and AI Landscape**  
   - Why: How AI shows up in everyday products and jobs; second-person hook on impact.  
   - What: AI vs. ML vs. deep learning; common tasks; historical milestones.  
   - How: Lightweight demos using Colab to inspect prebuilt notebooks; reading assignments with accessibility-first formatting.  
   - Apply: Mini activity mapping AI touchpoints in learners' workflows.  
   - Assess: Low-stakes quiz with feedback for each option.  
   - Playful context: Quick dolphin fact illustrating pattern recognition (dolphins naming each other via whistles) to model signal processing.

2. **Data, Labels, and Evaluation Mindsets**  
   - Why: Data quality drives trust and fairness; hook via real-world model mishap.  
   - What: Datasets, labels, splits, leakage, bias; precision/recall intuition.  
   - How: Walkthrough of dataset exploration in Colab using pandas/NumPy (no code heavy steps).  
   - Apply: Learners annotate a toy dataset schema and propose a validation split.  
   - Assess: Quiz with scenario-based questions and variations.  
   - Playful context: Dolphin sonar analogy to highlight signal-to-noise when labeling.

3. **Responsible AI Principles in Practice**  
   - Why: Trust and safety as differentiators for teams.  
   - What: Google AI Principles, fairness notions, privacy basics, human-in-the-loop safeguards.  
   - How: Case study walkthrough; link to optional open-access reading.  
   - Apply: Bias-spotting checklist applied to a simple image classification scenario.  
   - Assess: Short reflection and auto-graded quiz referencing review items.  
   - Playful context: Dolphin pod cooperation story to illustrate human oversight.

4. **From Idea to Experiment Plan**  
   - Why: Good plans reduce iteration time; hook on shipping value sooner.  
   - What: Problem framing, success metrics, data contracts, and risks.  
   - How: Template-driven planning exercise using Google Docs/Sheets.  
   - Apply: Learners draft a one-page experiment plan for a chosen scenario.  
   - Assess: Rubric-aligned peer review with transparent criteria.  
   - Playful context: Dolphin navigation map as a metaphor for planning experiments.

## Assessments and Practice
- Per-module quizzes (with option-level feedback and variations for graded items). 
- Reflection prompts aligned to responsible AI checkpoints.

## Tools and Logistics
- Primary tools: Google Colab (no local installs), Sheets/Docs templates.
- Accessibility: transcripts/captions, alt text for visuals, low-bandwidth downloads.
