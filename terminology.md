# Getting Started: Coursera Terminology

Use this terminology cheat sheet to familiarize yourself with common Coursera terms. You'll often see these terms while authoring content on the platform and in our Educator Resource Center. Each term includes links to relevant articles and/or best practice guidelines.

## Assessment

Assessments facilitate practice, feedback, and evaluation. These are all essential components of online learning. Successful online courses include a mixture of practice (formative) and graded (summative) assessments.

Practice assessments are optional and ungraded, and they don't count towards a learner's final course grade. Practice assessments support learning by helping learners self-assess their progress and master skills they've learned. They also give you a chance to provide learners with meaningful feedback.

Graded assessments give learners a chance to apply what they've learned. They measure a learner’s level of mastery and progress toward a learning objective. Graded assessments are required and count towards a learner's final course grade.

## Coach Dialogue

Dialogue items are course activities that enable authors to create AI-driven discussions, simulating interactions with a live instructor. These items lead learners through structured, text-based conversations designed to achieve specific learning objectives.

In a live Dialogue experience, the AI guide (Coursera Coach) helps learners think critically and apply course concepts to real-world situations by asking adaptive, open-ended questions. Dialogues are tailored to each learner, providing personalized feedback that drives progress and deepens understanding.

## Course

Courses give learners all over the world access to instructional videos, assessments, and other learning content created by top instructors from world-class universities and companies. Learners who pay for and complete a course earn a shareable course certificate that recognizes their accomplishments and promotes the skills they’ve learned.

Each course should include at least 15 hours of content, delivered in four to six modules. A series of four to seven courses make up a Specialization.

Learn more about course content specifications, requirements, and recommendations.

## Discussion prompt

Discussion prompts are course items that have learners to respond to a question you may typically ask in an on-campus lecture or during office hours.

When used alongside in-video questions and reflective questions, discussion prompts can promote active reflection. They can also foster feedback by enabling discussion, clarification, and debate amongst peers.

Learn more about discussion prompts.

Info iconNote:

Discussion prompts should always be open-ended and encourage various perspectives.

## In-browser coding

In-browser coding refers to course items that allow for complex inputs, such as code expressions, data sets, and more. Learners complete these hands-on activities without leaving the Coursera platform or setting up a local development environment.

We currently support three types of in-browser coding:

- Executable code blocks
- Programming assignments
- Coursera Labs

Learn more about in-browser coding.

## In-video question (IVQ)

In-video questions (IVQs) are short, ungraded questions embedded in videos. They pause videos and prompt learners to answer a question, respond to a poll, or reflect on a concept before continuing.

When used well, IVQs can be powerful teaching tools. They encourage active engagement with video content and promote regular self-assessment. You can also use IVQs to notify learners of a correction to a video.

## Module

A module acts as the fundamental container of content within a course. Modules make up the overall course structure and schedule. On Coursera, learners complete modules at their own pace based on personalized deadlines that reflect their own learning goals.

Learn more about modules.

## Peer review assignment

In peer review assignments, learners review and grade each other’s work based on a rubric you provide. The review process is part of the learning experience and should be as informative as the submission itself. Peer review assignments can help facilitate the grading of open-ended assignments, such as essays, art/design projects, and coding projects.

Learn more about peer review assignments.

## Plugin

Plugins let you embed single-page web applications within a Coursera course item. They’re created by third-parties including university partners, independent software developers, and researchers. Because plugins are web applications, they support nearly any experience on the web.

Plugins can be included as ungraded items, graded assignment questions, or full third-party applications like external surveys.

Learn more about plugins.

## Programming assignment

Programming assignments are auto-graded and allow complex inputs (e.g., code and data sets). They're intended for projects that require learners to produce and submit a specific formatted output. These outputs are compared to a specific numeric value, numeric range, or regular expression provided by you.

Learn more about programming assignments.

## Specialization

A Specialization is a series of four to seven in-depth courses that help learners develop mastery in a high-demand subject. Specializations include projects, which are hands-on assessments with real-world applications.

Learners who complete an entire Specialization earn a Specialization certificate. In some cases, this certificate counts toward earning an accredited degree on Coursera.

Learn more about Specialization content specifications, requirements, and recommendations.

## Video item

Videos introduce and teach a course topic. Each video item should be short and focused (ideally three to nine minutes in length).

Learn more about video items.
